The AI engineer successfully brought the Kryptonite application from 0 to 1, as an MVP. Subsequent interactions focused on debugging reported issues and architectural discussions. Initial tasks involved confirming the plan, followed by testing the backend, which passed. A critical server error (due to  and WebRTC conflicts) led to extensive dependency debugging, culminating in temporarily disabling WebRTC. The write to author function was fixed by replacing  with a custom modal and correcting API URL configuration, along with enabling message sending via the Enter key. Post creation had issues with the '+' button not working and the screen not closing; the button was fixed, but the post-creation redirect and API URL resolution remained problematic. The AI engineer attempted to re-integrate WebRTC multiple times, but consistently faced import errors, leading to its re-disabling for the web version. The user introduced new architectural requirements: backend separation into a dedicated project for Kubernetes/Docker deployment and migrating the database to PostgreSQL. The current state reflects ongoing debugging of API URL paths and post-creation flow.

<product_requirements>
The Kryptonite application is a cross-platform (iOS 14.0+, Android 10+) mobile app for anonymous sharing and support. Its core features include full anonymity with temporary IDs, post creation (text, base64 images, tags), anonymous commenting, private messaging (end-to-end encrypted) initiated by Write to Author, and anonymous WebRTC audio calls (time-limited) within PMs. The design emphasizes a minimalist, dark palette with intuitive tab-based navigation. A moderation system for reporting and blocking content/users is planned. The application is built with Expo React Native (frontend) and FastAPI with MongoDB (backend). The user explicitly requested to separate the backend into a dedicated project for Kubernetes/Docker deployment and migrate the database to PostgreSQL.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a persistent issue where the create post screen does not reliably close after a successful post submission, despite  being implemented. This is intertwined with ongoing debugging of API URL configuration in the frontend, as network requests sometimes return 404 errors due to incorrect base paths (e.g., ). The  in  is a key focus for this, as it has been a source of repeated issues due to environment forks and web platform differences.
Simultaneously, the user has introduced new, significant architectural requirements concerning the backend. These include separating the backend into a dedicated project for deployment in Kubernetes/Docker and migrating the database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. The AI engineer is in the process of formulating a plan to address these architectural changes alongside the outstanding frontend bugs.
